# NES emulator

![Mario](mario.gif)

Yep, another one.

This is just a hobby project I did for educational purposes. It can play mapper {0,1,2,3,4,7} games and most games I've tested so far seem to work. 

# Usage instructions

```
Usage: nes <filename> [-d]

    Positional Arguments:
    filename          nes ROM to load

    Options:
    -d, --debug       open debugger
    --help            display usage information
```

It supports up to 8 save states. Select a save state slot with number keys 1 through 9 and use F5 to save and F7 to load.

NOTE: The emulator requires a controller to play.

# Compatibility
Games that have been partially tested:

- Arkanoid
- Battletoads
- Bomberman

I don't recommend actually using the emulator. Besides not being fully accurate, the number of playable games is not great due to not many mappers being implemented and the user interface leaves much to be desired.
